  abstract =     {Industrial and scientific datasets have been growing
                  enormously in size and complexity in recent
                  years. The largest transactional databases and data
                  warehouses can no longer be hosted cost-effectively
                  in off-the-shelf commercial database management
                  systems. There are other forums for discussing
                  databases and data warehouses, but they typically
                  deal with problems occurring at smaller scales and
                  do not always focus on practical solutions or
                  influencing DBMS vendors. Given the relatively small
                  (but highly influential and growing) number of users
                  with these databases and the relatively small number
                  of opportunities to exchange practical information
                  related to DBMSes at extremely large scale, a
                  workshop on extremely large databases was

                  data-driven science and database research
                  communities was organized in response to suggestions
                  at the first XLDB Workshop. The goal was to develop
                  common requirements and primitives for a
                  next-generation database management system that
                  scientists would use, including those from
                  high-energy physics, astronomy, biology, geoscience
                  and fusion, in order to stimulate research and
                  advance technology. These requirements were thought
                  by the database researchers to be novel and unlikely
                  to be fully met by current commercial vendors. The
                  two groups accordingly decided to explore building a
                  new open source DBMS. This paper is the final report
                  of the discussions and activities at the workshop.},

  abstract =     {For the past year, we have been assembling
                  requirements from a collection of scientific data
                  base users from astronomy, particle physics, fusion,
                  remote sensing, oceanography, and biology. The
                  intent has been to specify a common set of
                  requirements for a new science data base system,
                  which we call SciDB. In addition, we have discovered
                  that very complex business analytics share most of
                  the same requirements as "big science". We have also
                  constructed a partnership of companies to fund the
                  development of SciDB, including eBay, the Large
                  Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Microsoft, the
                  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
                  Vertica. Lastly, we have identified two "lighthouse
                  customers" (LSST and eBay) who will run the initial
                  system, once it is constructed. In this paper, we
                  report on the requirements we have identified and
                  briefly sketch some of the SciDB design.},

                  managing and analyzing such large data sets still
                  remains a daunting task. Both the database and the
                  map/reduce communities worldwide are working on
                  addressing these issues. The 3rd Extremely Large
                  Databases workshop was organized to examine the
                  needs of scientific communities beginning to face
                  these issues, to reach out to European communities
                  working on extremely large scale data challenges,
                  and to brainstorm possible solutions. The science
                  benchmark that emerged from the 2nd workshop in this
                  series was also debated. This paper is the final
                  report of the discussions and activities at this

                  between users trying to build extremely large
                  databases worldwide and database solution providers;
                  (2) Share lessons, trends, innovations, and
                  challenges related to building extremely large
                  databases; (3) Facilitate the development and growth
                  of practical technologies for extremely large
                  databases; and (4) Strengthen, expand, and engage
                  the XLDB community.},

                  institution-backed software funding (eg. IRAF,
                  Starlink) to grant-backed funding at University
                  research groups. Is this polycosm resulting in a
                  Darwinian triumph of fitter ideas, or is it a
                  constant re-invention of the wheel that is stopping
                  us from making cumulative progress as a field? Is
                  there a benefit to retaining long-term software
                  engineering talent, and if so, can this be done on
                  the grant system? Is it a good idea to have our
                  software written by postdocs? By contractors? How do
                  we compete in the free market for tech talent? Are
                  open-source inspired initiatives (eg. AstroPy) a
                  solution? How does the funding model for astronomy
                  software impact the code produced, and can anybody

                  pixels into catalogs, on simulated images and
                  existing time domain surveys. A 250
                  sq. deg. repeatedly-imaged stripe of the SDSS called
                  Stripe 82 provides a strong test dataset because it
                  was obtained under skies with highly variable
                  conditions. Reprocessing the 20TB of imaging
                  consisted of detecting sources on i-band co-adds but
                  measuring flux on the single-epoch (ugriz) images,
                  generating complete and less biased lightcurves for
                  sources fainter than the single-epoch detection
                  threshold. I will describe the technical challenges
                  of aggregating these 16 billion photometry
                  measurements into lightcurve metrics for each of the
                  40 million objects. I will also discuss our
                  application of ensemble classifiers to this dataset
                  to select z~4 quasars with care to maintain the
                  ability to estimate the completeness of the sample
